Helloo!

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at Statistics Canada. At heart, I love building end-end products and believe in life long learning. 
I did my master's in Computer science from Simon Fraser University with a focus in Big Data and ML.

In my free-time, I enjoy hiking, biking and reading  fiction and non-fiction books.

Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or my email!
