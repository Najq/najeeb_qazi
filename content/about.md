Helloo!

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at Statistics Canada. At heart, I love building end-end products and believe in life long learning. 
I did my master's in Computer science from Simon Fraser University with a focus in Big Data and ML.

In an attempt to lead a balanced life - I enjoy hiking, biking and reading fiction and non-fiction books.

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/najeeb-qazi/) or my [e-mail](mailto:najeebq@gmail.com)!
