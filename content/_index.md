### Welcome to my room on the internet!

Hello there!<span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">:wave:</span>

I'm Najeeb if you missed my name by any chance. I love technology and everything related to it.

Enjoy building websites among other things, and currently working on cool Machine learning and Data Scienc-y stuff @ Statistics Canada!

<!-- <img src="/images/wow_contemplate.jpg" alt="me in the wild"
	title="A cute human" width="150" height="100" /> -->

I'm based in Vancouver, Canada and absolutely love the city (finding it hard not to)

This site is under construction, if you find any bugs - feel free to shoot me a message. 

It's built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a super awesome static site generator which is blazingly fast. 



<!--
This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backward compatible with initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
