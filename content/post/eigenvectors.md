Truly understanding Principal Component Analysis (PCA) requires a clear understanding of the concepts behind linear algebra, especially Eigenvectors. There are many articles out there explaining PCA and its importance, though I found a handful explaining the intuition behind Eigenvectors in the light of PCA.
This article aims to give a visual and intuitive understanding of Eigenvectors, such that it makes you better equipped to understand PCA. The steps of the PCA algorithm are not the main focus of this article.
First, I would like to start off by visualizing some basic concepts underlying linear algebra.
